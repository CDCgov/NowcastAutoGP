## About NowcastAutoGP.jl

**NowcastAutoGP.jl** is a specialized Julia package developed by CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics for automated nowcasting of epidemiological time series data using Gaussian processes. This tool directly supports CFA's core functions of:

- **Real-time epidemic monitoring** and trend analysis
- **Outbreak response analytics** with uncertainty quantification
- **Public health forecasting** for resource planning and policy decisions
- **Data-driven decision support** during health emergencies

Nowcasting in public health refers to estimating current disease activity while accounting for reporting delays common in surveillance systems. This capability is essential for CFA's mission to provide timely, actionable intelligence during public health responses.

## Public Health Quick Start

Here's an example for nowcasting influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance data:

```julia
using NowcastAutoGP
using Dates

# Example: Weekly ILI surveillance data with reporting delays
surveillance_dates = Date(2023, 10, 1):Week(1):Date(2024, 3, 1)
ili_rates = [2.1, 2.3, 2.8, 3.1, 3.7, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 4.9, 4.5, 4.1, 3.8,
             3.4, 3.0, 2.7, 2.4, 2.2, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, missing, missing]

# Create epidemiologically-appropriate transformed data
# Log transformation common for disease rates
tdata = create_transformed_data(surveillance_dates, ili_rates;
                               transformation = log,
                               handle_missing = true)

# Fit Gaussian Process model optimized for surveillance data
gp_model = make_and_fit_model(tdata)

# Generate nowcast for current time period (accounting for reporting delay)
current_date = Date(2024, 3, 1)
nowcast_horizon = Week(2)  # Account for 2-week reporting delay

nowcast_results = forecast(gp_model,
                          [current_date - nowcast_horizon, current_date],
                          1000;  # Monte Carlo samples for uncertainty
                          inv_transformation = exp)

# Extract epidemiologically-relevant outputs
current_ili_estimate = nowcast_results.mean[end]
credible_interval_95 = (nowcast_results.quantile_05[end],
                       nowcast_results.quantile_95[end])

println("Current ILI activity estimate: $(round(current_ili_estimate, digits=2))%")
println("95% credible interval: $(round.(credible_interval_95, digits=2))")
```

## Epidemiological Use Cases

### **Infectious Disease Surveillance**
- **Influenza monitoring**: Weekly ILI and laboratory-confirmed cases
- **COVID-19 surveillance**: Hospitalizations, deaths, and wastewater signals

### **Emergency Response Applications**
- **Outbreak detection**: Early warning systems for anomalous activity

## Mathematical Framework for Epidemiologists

The package implements Gaussian Process regression specifically adapted for epidemiological time series:

**Model Structure:**
```
y(t) = f(t) + Îµ(t)
```

Where:
- `y(t)`: Observed surveillance data (possibly transformed)
- `f(t)`: Latent disease activity (Gaussian process)
- `Îµ(t)`: Observation noise (reporting errors, measurement uncertainty)

**Key Adaptations for Public Health:**
- **Epidemiological priors**: Informed kernel selection for disease dynamics
- **Reporting delay modeling**: Explicit handling of surveillance system delays
- **Uncertainty propagation**: Full posterior distributions for risk assessment
- **Transform robustness**: Appropriate handling of rates, proportions, and counts

## Performance for Operational Surveillance

- **Real-time capability**: Optimized for operational surveillance timelines
- **Scalable architecture**: Handles multiple surveillance streams simultaneously
- **Memory efficiency**: Designed for continuous operational use
- **Parallel ensemble generation**: Accelerated uncertainty quantification
