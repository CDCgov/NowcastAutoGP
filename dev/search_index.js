to make inference on the **stable** part of the time series data using\n  sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) over sequences of data ingestion over\n  n_particle SMC particles Each particle represents a Gaussian\n  process (GP) model for the time series and at each data ingestion\n  step this particle ensemble can be resampled Within each SMC particle\n  new possible GP kernel structures and hyperparmeter values are\n  proposed using a specialised MCMC proposal distribution for structural\n  choices (see AutoGP\n  overview(httpsprobsysgithubioAutoGPjlstableapihtml) for\n  details) and HMC for continuous parameter samples\n\n- NowcastAutoGPforecast_with_nowcasts This batches over proposed\n  nowcasts for recent data incrementally adding nowcast *possible* data\n  to make forecasts before removing The forecast distribution is the\n  batch of forecasts over nowcasts of recent data\n\n Using NowcastAutoGP with NHSN hospitalisation data\n\n Loading dependencies\n\n julia\nusing

use AutoGP on the latest reported data without\nconsidering revisions This will be biased because we know that\ntypically the most recent data will be revised upwards but represents a\ncommon error when using this data stream\n\n julia\nn_forecasts = 2000\nnaive_forecasts_by_reference_date = map(selected_dates) do report_date\n     Filter for correct report date\n    date_data = chain training_data begin\n            filter(report_date == report_date)\n            arrange(reference_date)\n        end\n    model forecast_dates transformation inv_transformation = fit_on_data(report_date\n                        n_redact = 0\n                        date_data = date_data\n                        )\n    forecasts = forecast(model forecast_dates n_forecasts inv_transformation)\n\n    iqr_forecasts = mapreduce(vcat eachrow(forecasts)) do fc\n        qs = quantile(fc 025 05 075)\n        qs\n    end\n\n    return (dates = forecast_dates forecasts = forecasts iqrs = iqr_forecasts)\nend\n\n\nWhen we plot we see that the unrevised data consistently underestimates\nthe eventual counts which leads to poor forecasting\n\n julia\nplot_with_forecasts(naive_forecasts_by_reference_date Forecasts from Different Report Dates (naive)\n                        n_ahead = 4\n                            selected_dates = selected_dates\n    )\n\n\nimg src=assetstutorialcell-10-output-1png\nwidth=1000 height=700 \n\n Approach 2 Removing uncertain data\n\nWe note that the problem is *mainly* with the most recent week of\nhospitalisation reports Therefore another strategy could be to simply\nredact that week but otherwise leave out forecasting untouched\n\n julia\n\nleave_out_last_forecasts_by_reference_date = map(selected_dates) do report_date\n    date_data = chain training_data begin\n                filter(report_date == report_date)\n                arrange(reference_date)\n            end\n    model forecast_dates transformation inv_transformation = fit_on_data(report_date\n                            n_redact = 1  Ignore last week of data\n                            date_data = date_data\n

have effectively bumped the forecast horizon by one week)\n\n julia\nplot_with_forecasts(leave_out_last_forecasts_by_reference_date Forecasts from Different Report Dates (Leave out last week)\n                            n_ahead = 4\n                            selected_dates = selected_dates\n    )\n\n\nimg src=assetstutorialcell-12-output-1png\nwidth=1000 height=700 \n\n Approach 3 Forecasting with a simple nowcast\n\nNow lets consider a really simple nowcasting model Over recent vintages\nwe notice that the most recent week gets revised significantly but other\nweeks are fairly stable Therefore we fit the ratio of last weeks\nreport to last weeks eventual reported to a LogNormal The MLE fit for\nthis was LogNormal(logmean = 01 logstd = 0027)\n\nIn the following example for each vintage we first fit to all the data\nexcept the most recent week (n_redact = 1) Second we sample a\nmultiplier for the most recent week from the LogNormal distribution 100\ntimes Third we use forecast_with_nowcasts to batch 20 forecasts per\nnowcast signal ontop of the inference done in step one\n\nThis is a very simple nowcasting approach Note that cached nowcasts\nfrom a more sophisticated approach such as a full generative model\ndefined by eg epinowcast(httpspackageepinowcastorg) or\nbaselinenowcast(httpsbaselinenowcastepinowcastorg) could have\nbeen deserialized into this approach\n\n julia\nn_nowcast_samples = 100\nnowcast_forecasts_by_reference_date = map(selected_dates) do report_date\n     Filter for correct report date\n    date_data = chain training_data begin\n            filter(report_date == report_date)\n            arrange(reference_date)\n        end\n     Fit on all accepted data\n    model forecast_dates transformation inv_transformation = fit_on_data(report_date\n                        n_redact = 1\n                        date_data = date_data\n                        )\n     Simple nowcast on most recent data where we suspect significant revisions\n    nowcast_samples = date_dataconfirmend * exp(01 + randn() * 0027) for _ = 1n_nowcast_samples\n\n    nowcasts = create_nowcast_data(nowcast_samples

iqr_forecasts = mapreduce(vcat eachrow(forecasts)) do fc\n        qs = quantile(fc 025 05 075)\n        qs\n    end\n\n    return (dates = forecast_dates forecasts = forecasts iqrs = iqr_forecasts)\nend\n\n\nWe see that this significantly improves the forecasting visually\n\n julia\nplot_with_forecasts(nowcast_forecasts_by_reference_date Forecasts from Different Report Dates

Scoring\n\nTo evaluate the quality of our different forecasting approaches we use\nproper scoring rules A proper scoring rule is a function that assigns a\nnumerical score to a probabilistic forecast with the property that the\nscore is optimized (in expectation) when the forecast distribution\nmatches the true future data distribution\n\nThe **Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)** is a proper scoring\nrule that generalizes the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts For\na forecast distribution F(x) = P(X leq x) and observed outcome y\nthe CRPS is defined as\n\ntextCRPS(X y) =
