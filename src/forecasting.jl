    forecast(model, forecast_dates, forecast_draws::Int)

Generate forecasts using the fitted `AutoGP` model.

# Arguments
- `model`: The fitted GP model.
- `forecast_dates`: A vector of dates for which to generate forecasts.
- `forecast_draws`: The number of forecast samples to draw (default: 2000).
# Returns
- A matrix of forecast samples, where each column corresponds to a sample for the respective date.

Generate forecasts incorporating uncertainty from nowcast data by updating a base GP model with each nowcast scenario.

# Arguments
- `base_model`: A fitted GP model representing the baseline model (trained on historical data without nowcast period).
- `nowcasts`: A vector of nowcast data objects, each a NamedTuple with fields `ds` (dates), `y` (transformed values), and `values` (original values).
- `forecast_dates`: A vector or range of dates for which to generate forecasts.
- `forecast_draws_per_nowcast`: The number of forecast samples to draw per nowcast scenario.
- `inv_transformation`: A function to apply inverse transformation to forecasts (default: identity).
- `n_mcmc`: Number of MCMC structure steps for model refinement after adding nowcast data (default: 0). If > 0, `n_hmc` must also be > 0.
- `n_hmc`: Number of HMC parameter steps per MCMC step (default: 0). Can be > 0 even if `n_mcmc` = 0 for parameter-only updates.
- `ess_threshold`: Effective Sample Size threshold for particle resampling, as a fraction of total particles (default: 0.0, meaning don't resample).

# Returns
A matrix with dimensions `(length(forecast_dates), length(nowcasts) * forecast_draws_per_nowcast)`. Each set of `forecast_draws_per_nowcast` columns represents forecasts for one nowcast scenario, concatenated horizontally across all scenarios.

# Notes
- The `base_model` should be fitted on historical data that does not temporally overlap with the nowcast period
- Each nowcast represents a different realization of the uncertain nowcast values
- Setting `n_mcmc = 0, n_hmc > 0` performs only parameter updates without structure changes
- Setting both `n_mcmc > 0, n_hmc > 0` performs full MCMC including structure updates
- The function asserts that nowcasts is non-empty and validates MCMC parameter combinations

```julia
# Assume base_model is fitted on historical data
nowcast_scenarios = [
    (ds = [Date(2024,1,1), Date(2024,1,2)], y = [10.5, 11.2], values = [10.5, 11.2]),

]
forecast_dates = Date(2024,1,1):Day(1):Date(2024,1,10) # Can overlap with nowcast dates for predictive sampling as well as forecasting
