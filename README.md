**Automated Gaussian Process model discovery for time series data with significant on-going revisions**

## About

**NowcastAutoGP.jl** is a Julia package for combining **nowcasting** of epidemiological time series data with **forecasting** using an ensemble of Gaussian process (GP) models. The package was developed for the [CDC Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA)](https://www.cdc.gov/forecasting/index.html) to support real-time situational awareness and epidemiological forecasting.

The basic idea is to use the incremental fitting capabilities of [`AutoGP.jl`](https://github.com/probsys/AutoGP.jl) to batch forecasts over probabilistic nowcasts of recent data points. This accounts for uncertainty in recent data points that are still being revised, while leveraging the flexibility and scalability of Gaussian processes for forecasting.

### Key Features

- **Nowcasting integration**: Handles data revision uncertainty in recent time periods
- **Flexible approach**: Agnostic to the nowcasting method used
- **Ensemble forecasting**: Uses Gaussian process model discovery for robust predictions
- **Real-time capable**: Designed for operational epidemiological surveillance

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/CDCgov/NowcastAutoGP.jl")
```

## Example Results

The package demonstrates significant improvements over naive forecasting approaches when dealing with data subject to reporting delays:

*Naive forecasting consistently underestimates due to reporting delays*

![Forecasts with simple nowcasting](docs/src/assets/tutorial/cell-14-output-1.png)
*Forecasts incorporating simple nowcasting show improved accuracy*

*Score ratios demonstrate clear performance improvements with nowcasting*
